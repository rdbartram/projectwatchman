# Project Watchman

RFC documents for a PowerShell based cross platform LCM

See https://github.com/rdbartram/projectwatchman/blob/master/RFC0000-RFC-Process.md for process information

We want to inviting the community to author RFCs on features and changes to the project. The Team will discuss
once a week (depending on amount of feedback) to review the feedback and respond.

We'll continue to refine this process as we learn from it.
